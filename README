Binary Clock Codes

See there are two files. 
One of them is a solution code. So try to write your code before looking at the solution.

Pseudo Code for the turnDigitOn function
void function turnDigitOn
for each i in range start_index to finish_index {
	if digit is divisible by 2
		turn pin[i] off
	else
		turn pin[i] on
	set digit to digit divided by 2
}
